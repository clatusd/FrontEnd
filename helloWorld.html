        <h2>1. Helps you stay hydrated</h2>
        <p>
            Staying hydrated is important for your body to function properly.
            Body temperature regulation, normal organ function, nutrient delivery to cells, and alertness are only some of the bodily processes that rely on adequate hydration (2Trusted Source).           
            Eating foods with a high water content may help give your body the water it needs to function properly.           
            Watermelon comprises 92% water, making it a great choice for daily water intake (3Trusted Source).            
            Furthermore, due to its high water content, this melon has a low calorie density — in other words, very few calories for its total weight.           
            Eating foods with low calorie densities, such as watermelon, may aid weight management by keeping you feeling full for longer (4Trusted Source).
